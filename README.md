# Cross-Platform Music Link Aggregator

## Overview

This Cross-Platform Music Link Aggregator is an Angular-based web application that allows users to search for music tracks using the Spotify API and then aggregates links to the same track across various music platforms. It provides a user-friendly interface for discovering where a particular track is available, showcasing modern web development practices and API integration techniques.

## Key Features

- **Music Search**: Users can search for tracks using keywords, artist names, or song titles via the Spotify API.
- **Cross-Platform Link Aggregation**: The app fetches and displays links to the searched track from multiple music platforms.
- **Responsive Results Display**: Search results and aggregated links are presented in a clean, responsive layout.
- **Detailed Track Information**: For each track, the app shows:
  - Track name
  - Artist(s)
  - Album
  - Release date
  - Album cover image
  - Links to various music platforms
  - ISRC (International Standard Recording Code)
- **Pagination**: Initially displays a limited number of results with a "Show More" button to load additional results.
- **Animations**: Smooth fade-in animations for search results to enhance user experience.
- **Routing**: Implemented Angular routing for navigation between search results and detailed track views.

## Technologies Used

- Angular (latest version)
- TypeScript
- RxJS for reactive programming
- Angular Animations
- Spotify Web API
- Custom API integration for fetching links from various music platforms

## Goals of the Project

1. Demonstrate the ability to create a web application that aggregates data from multiple sources.
2. Showcase proficiency in building modern, responsive web applications using Angular.
3. Highlight skills in integrating and working with various third-party APIs.
4. Implement best practices in component design, state management, and responsive UI development.
5. Provide a useful tool for music listeners to find their favorite tracks across different platforms.
6. Demonstrate understanding of asynchronous programming and efficient data handling in web applications.

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- Expand the range of supported music platforms.
- Implement user accounts to save favorite tracks and search history.
- Add more detailed artist and album information pages.
- Integrate music preview functionality where available.
- Implement advanced search filters (by genre, year, etc.).
